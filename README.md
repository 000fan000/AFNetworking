# AFNetworking
## A delightful iOS networking library with NSOperations and block-based callbacks

**There's a lot to be said for a networking library that you can wrap your head around. API design matters, too--code at its best is poetry, and should be designed to delight (but never surprise).**

AFNetworking was lovingly crafted to make best use of our favorite parts of Apple's `Foundation` framework: `NSOperation` for managing multiple concurrent requests, `NSURLRequest` & `NSHTTPURLResponse` to encapsulate state, `NSURLCache` for performant and compliant cacheing behavior, and blocks to keep HTTP request / response handling code in a single logical unit in code.

If you're tired of massive libraries that try to do too much, if you've taken it upon yourself to roll your own hacky solution, if you want a library that _actually makes iOS networking code kinda fun_, try out AFNetworking.

## Example Usage

### GET Request

    NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://gowalla.com/users/mattt.json"]];
    AFCallback *callback = [AFHTTPOperationCallback callbackWithSuccess:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSDictionary *data) {
        NSLog(@"Name: %@ %@", [data valueForKeyPath:@"first_name"], [data valueForKeyPath:@"last_name"]);
    }];
    [[AFHTTPOperation operationWithRequest:request callback:callback] start];

### POST Request With HTTP Authorization Header Using `NSOperationQueue`

    NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://gowalla.com/friendships/request?user_id=1699"]];
    [request setHTTPMethod:@"POST"];

    NSDictionary *headers = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"Token token=\"%@\"", kOAuthToken] forKey:@"Authorization"];
    [request setAllHTTPHeaderFields:headers];
    
    AFCallback *callback = [AFHTTPOperationCallback callbackWithSuccess:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSDictionary *data) {
        NSLog(@"Friend Request Sent");;
    } error:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
        NSLog(@"[Error] (%@ %@) %@", [request HTTPMethod], [[request URL] relativePath], error);
    }];
    
    AFHTTPOperation *operation = [AFHTTPOperation operationWithRequest:request callback:callback];
    [[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] addOperation:operation];

### Image Request

    NSURL *imageURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://s3.amazonaws.com/static.gowalla.com/users/1699-standard.jpg"];
    NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:imageURL];
    
    AFCallback *callback = [AFImageRequestOperationCallback callbackWithSuccess:^(UIImage *image) {
        self.imageView.image = image;
    } imageSize:CGSizeMake(50.0f, 50.0f) options:AFImageRequestResize | AFImageRequestRoundCorners];
    [[AFImageRequestOperation operationWithRequest:request callback:callback] start];
    
### REST Client Request

    // AFGowallaAPIClient is a subclass of AFRestClient, which defines the base URL and default HTTP  headers of NSURLRequests it creates
    [[AFGowallaAPIClient sharedClient] getPath:@"/spots/9223" parameters:nil callback:[AFHTTPOperationCallback callbackWithSuccess:^(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSDictionary *data) {
      NSLog(@"%@: %@", [data valueForKeyPath:@"name"], [data valueForKeyPath:@"address.street_address"]);
    }]];

## Example Project

In order to demonstrate the power and flexibility of AFNetworking, we've included a small sample project. `AFNetworkingExample` asks for your current location and displays [Gowalla](http://gowalla.com/) spots nearby you. It uses `AFHTTPOperation` to load and parse the spots JSON, and `AFImageRequestOperation` to asynchronously load spot stamp images as you scroll.

Take a close look at `AFGowallaAPIClient` and `AFImageRequest`. These two classes provide convenience methods on top of the core AFNetworking classes. They provide higher-level methods for creating requests, and enqueueing them into an `NSOperationQueue`.

## Dependencies

* [iOS 4](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniPhoneOS/Articles/iPhoneOS4.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009559-SW1) - `AFNetworking` uses blocks, which were introduced in iOS 4.
*  [QHTTPOperation](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/MVCNetworking/Listings/Networking_QHTTPOperation_m.html) - Underneath `AFHTTPOperation` and `AFImageRequestOperation` is `QHTTPOperation`, an `NSOperation` subclass that manages `NSURLConnection` delegate methods. It's fairly robust, performant, and complete, so rather than roll our own, we built `AFNetworking` on top of this. We may build our own replacement if the need arises.
* [JSONKit](https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit) - One of the conveniences built into `AFHTTPOperation` is automatic JSON parsing for HTTP requests that return content-type `application/json`. JSONKit is our preferred JSON parsing library, and is included in the example project.

AFNetworking was created by [Scott Raymond](https://github.com/sco/) and [Mattt Thompson](https://github.com/mattt/) in the development of [Gowalla for iPhone](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gowalla/id304510106?mt=8).

QRunLoopOperation and QHTTPOperation were created by Apple DTS Engineers as a part of the sample code project [MVC Networking](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/MVCNetworking/Introduction/Intro.html). See corresponding files for copyright and usage information.

[TTTLocationFormatter], used in the example project, was created by [Mattt Thompson](https://github.com/mattt/).
